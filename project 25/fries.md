In this french fried recipe method, cut potatoes are kept in cold water for 30 minutes. They are then drained and towel dried before getting fried twice.

Both of these steps are invaluable in creating the perfect fry. While they take a bit of work, these homemade french fries are crisp from the outside, soft & tender from inside, just the way the french fries should be.

The process of soaking the potatoes removes excess starch from the spuds, meaning they can crisp up beautifully and keep from sticking together. Towel drying removes the excess water, which can sputter and snap when you add the potatoes to the oil.

The process of double frying is also important to creating the perfect french fry. The first fry helps to create a barrier on the exterior of the potato, as well as gives it time to cook all the way through. The second fry gives the potato that gorgeous golden hue and completes the cooking process so you donâ€™t end up with al dente finger chips.

For best results, use potatoes that have a high starch content. Russet potatoes, Yukon Gold potatoes, and Idaho potatoes are all good choices to make crispy yet tender french fries. Do not use new potatoes or potatoes having less starch.
